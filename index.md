I’m a Software Engineer with strong experience in **systems engineering**, **full-stack development**, **cloud automation**, and emerging interests in **DevOps** and **blockchain technologies**. I’m deeply committed to building reliable systems, scalable architectures, and clean, maintainable software.  

I enjoy exploring the intersection of backend engineering, security, infrastructure, and user-centered product design.  
Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I work on projects that strengthen performance, reliability, and real-world usability.

## Recent Work, Learning & Engineering Milestones  
### *(Projects, Courses, Workshops, Systems Engineering Work)*

**`2025:`**

- **February:** Strengthening my systems engineering and security skills while working on a cross-platform Remote Access Tool built in **Go**, designed for multi-OS execution and modular command pipelines.  
- **January:** Began building a full **Next.js Admin System** with Prisma, MongoDB, and role-based access control for managing users, wallets, transactions, and investment plans.  
  - Expanded the system to include wallet automation, staking modules, and server-side user management patterns.

---

**`2024:`**

- **December:** Advanced full-stack capabilities through complex dashboard development, including a **live stock & crypto analytics system** integrating multiple market APIs (Yahoo Finance, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage).  
- **September – November:** Deepened cloud computing and backend automation knowledge while working with server-side rendering, database optimization, rate-limited API orchestration, and secure authentication flows.  
- **June – August:** Completed major ALX engineering modules including:  
  - **Custom `printf` implementation in C**  
  - **Linux shell utilities**, Bash scripting, memory handling, pointer management, and low-level debugging with Valgrind.

---

**`2023:`**

- Grew foundational engineering skills across C, shell scripting, algorithms, and systems programming—building the groundwork that now supports backend engineering, DevOps, and cloud-native development.  
- Participated in collaborative open-source work and educational sprints that strengthened debugging discipline, code documentation, and collaborative coding workflows (Git, GitHub, CI basics).

---

**`2022:`**

- Joined the ALX Software Engineering Program, beginning formal training in:  
  - C programming  
  - Data structures  
  - Shell scripting  
  - Low-level algorithmic thinking  
  - Systems fundamentals  
- Started building early personal projects with Python, JavaScript, and REST APIs, forming the base of my full-stack trajectory.

## Additional Highlights

- Developing **DrivenLuxe**, a full ride-hailing platform with authentication, user onboarding, admin interfaces, and React Native mobile screens.  
- Actively creating modern UI/UX concepts on **Figma** for dashboards, fintech products, logistics tools, and system interfaces.  
- Building a portfolio of backend, security, and DevOps experiments including:  
  - MX record lookups  
  - Email automation and DNS tooling  
  - Firewalls, server configs, and Linux setups  
- Consistently improving cloud deployment, containerization, scaling strategies, and infrastructure-as-code patterns.

If you’d like, I can add:
- A **Projects** carousel  
- A **Figma UI Gallery** section  
- A **Tech Stack** module  
- A GitHub stats panel  
- A more polished intro with a tagline or mission statement

**Q1**  
**Do you want a section added that showcases your key projects (DrivenLuxe, Market Dashboard, Admin System, ALX C projects) with thumbnails and descriptions?**
